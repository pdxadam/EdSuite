This PHP service is a first stab at having a central repository for the json data of multiple apps.  It will allow sharing of an individual's appdata, but for now, only in a wholesale manner (all or none). 

Getting more granular would either mean diving into the json data on the server or making the data itself more granular.That defeats the purpose of rapid fire app deployment for custom, small-scale customer scenarios.
